# campaign-finance-pdf-to-excel
This code was used to convert public NYS campaign finance data from pdf to excel.

While working on an article for Gotham Gazette, I wanted to look at donations from 2016-2021 by the Real Estate Board of New York to political candidates for New York State office. However, all such documents are pdfs, and so to analyze the data would be troublesome and require a lot of manual labor. So, I coded this program to help to convert the pdf to a csv and do some basic data analysis. It does require the user to tell the program how to split up the names of donation recipients, although it has some presets and learns as it goes what words it should be splitting up. What I mean by this will become more clear once you read the file.

Enjoy!
